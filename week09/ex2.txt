The more of the referenced pages are in the table the more the hitting rate is. Then for a table with size of 5 we can input "1 2 3 4 5 7 3 5 2 6 1 3 4" for example. Most of those numbers are in the range of size, and since so, the hit ratio is relatively high. We could use whatever sequence with the range of n for n being the size of a table.

Hit ratio is 0 when we input numbers "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5" with a table of size 5. That happens since the range is twice as big as the size of a table (10 for zise of 5), so referencing to 1 second time we reference to the page that is no longer in page table.
